## Difference between `.js` and `.txt` file

The primary difference between a `.js` file and a `.txt` file lies in their intended purpose and execution capabilities.

### .js (JavaScript) files

- Contain structured JavaScript code designed to be executed by a JavaScript engine (e.g., in a web browser, Node.js).
- The content within a `.js` file follows the syntax and rules of the JavaScript programming language.
- These files are crucial for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages and for building server-side applications with Node.js.

### .txt (Text) files

- Contain plain, unformatted text data.
- They are generic text files and are not designed for execution as code.
- While they can store any text, including snippets of code, they lack the inherent structure and execution capability of a `.js` file.
- `.txt` files are commonly used for storing notes, documentation, or raw data.

#### In essence

- A `.js` file is a program meant to be run.
- A `.txt` file is a document meant to be read.
